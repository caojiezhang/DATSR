Reference-based image super-resolution (RefSR) aims to exploit auxiliary reference (Ref) images to super-resolve low-resolution (LR) images. Recently, RefSR has been attracting great attention as it provides an alternative way to surpass single image SR. However, addressing the RefSR problem has two critical challenges: (i) It is difficult to match the correspondence between LR and Ref images when they are significantly different; (ii) How to transfer the relevant texture from Ref images to compensate the details for LR images is very challenging. To address these issues of RefSR, this paper proposes a deformable attention Transformer, namely DATSR, with multiple scales, each of which consists of a texture feature encoder (TFE) module, a reference-based deformable attention (RDA) module and a residual feature aggregation (RFA) module. Specifically, TFE first extracts image transformation (e.g., brightness) insensitive features for LR and Ref images, RDA then can exploit multiple relevant textures to compensate more information for LR features, and RFA lastly aggregates LR features and relevant textures to get a more visually pleasant result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DATSR achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets quantitatively and qualitatively.

Please refer to [Datasets.md](datasets/DATASETS.md) for pre-processing and more details.

## Get Started

### Pretrained Models
Downloading the pretrained models from this [link](https://github.com/caojiezhang/DATSR/releases) and put them under `experiments/pretrained_model folder`.

### Test

We provide quick test code with the pretrained model.

```bash
# Run test code for models trained using only **reconstruction loss**.
PYTHONPATH="./:${PYTHONPATH}" python datsr/test.py -opt "options/test/test_restoration_mse.yml"

# Run test code for models trained using **GAN loss**.
PYTHONPATH="./:${PYTHONPATH}" python datsr/test.py -opt "options/test/test_restoration.yml"
```

## Training

Train restoration network
```bash
# Train the restoration network with only mse loss
PYTHONPATH="./:${PYTHONPATH}" python datsr/train.py -opt "options/train/train_restoration_mse.yml"

# Train the restoration network with all loss
PYTHONPATH="./:${PYTHONPATH}" python datsr/train.py -opt "options/train/train_restoration_gan.yml"
```

## Visual Results
